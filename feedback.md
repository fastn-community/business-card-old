Below UI feedback received from AmitU.

1. Change the CTA of the two buttons to "Create a site with business card" and "Add business card to your existing site". - Fixed
2. The buttons are too low, they must be visible above the fold.
> Right now above the fold (without scrolling) the end user buttons are hidden and link for contributors is shown. These buttons are priority, why are we hiding the button?
3. In the built with icon, is there a space between -- and built-with? Use a better font
> And why is it so tiny?
And we do not need built with
We need an icon to represent this is a fastn package meant to be used by others
Not that this is a site that is built with fastn
They are two different messages

4. Remove the license from the top. - Fixed
5. Also the sidebar that shows when we click on the link is the main sidebar, show it when i visit the page. - Added links into sidebar.
> Why are we hiding stuff is totally beyond me.
Also its kind of wrong, what does build mean?
Use the two button CTAs as the link on the sidebar as well - Fixed
6. put both the important links on sidebar and delete the garbage contribute button - Fixed
> (our end user does not care about contribute, but we are always showing that)
7. Of the two, add to existing is the primary cta, and create site is secondary - Fixed
8. make the top of the site look like hero section
9. Get rid of sidebar, we have only three pages, the links can be in the header, 
> why do we need the sidebar?
> In fact the how to add etc can be all in one page, we do not even need three pages
Forget doc-site. You are crating a website for business card. Take decisions for this, not defending some decisions etc
> And I want to see "Fastn Package" button today
It will be used on any package we create
End user should get it that this is a fastn package and they can use it for their website
And its perfectly fine to just put the fastn logo and "Package" next to it. Boring is fine.
10. After "create your repository" button the screenshot is only shown to people who are logged in. For non logged in users it will show the signup form.
> Given that most of people who will follow this journey will not be logged in, and most lilkely not even have github account, we should in our docs do a call out saying for this to work you will need a Github account, do not worry its free and you can create an account in 2 mins or something.
11. The actions screenshot does not show the entire github header, so people who are not familiar with Github, again 99%, will feel more at home if we show whole header. Also there is no reason to go to Actions page, they can wait for the commit to come. Ask them to reload the page till they see the commit.
12. Change the order of steps 3 and 4 https://fastn-community.github.io/business-card/create/. First do a quick edit with just a name change and publish website. Once user knows how to do that much then teach them about uploading image.
13. There are two step 4s on create page. Change the title of Step 4: Generate a live site for yourself to what you are actually doing, Step 4: Configure Github Pages
14. Also in the "Improve the URL accessibility", delete the image where you have written "copy the URL", it is not needed. In the "Edit repository details" ask people to click on the checkbox "use your Github Pages website".
15. Again in the about section, show the entire page so they know where the about section is. The user is seeing Github for the first time, you are not writing for power users who are completely familiar with sections of UI
16. Final output image is wrong. Show the screenshot of your browser with the URL etc.
17. In the Create a site with business card and Add business card to your existing site pages, remove the business card etc, the real content of these pages are coming after the first fold. The title of the document should be right below the header
18. Change the icon from built-with to "fastn package". https://trizwit.github.io/web3kevent/ is built with fastn. amitu.com is built with fastn. Built with fastn icon would look good for end users sites that are built with fastn. 
19. Business card is a resuable fastn package that can be used by other sites that are built with fastn. This is important distinction.
20. To highlight lines in code snippet or to show code snippet at all, use https://fastn-community.github.io/code-block/ not images.
21. Among the two cta, add business card to existing is our primary cta, the other one is secondary, change the colors to reflect that.
22. Also explanation of CTA comes below the CTA and our CTA is descriptive enough that we do not need the information. Nor we need the "Create your business card" heading.
23. Change the code caption from "Source Code" to "Example usage". - Fixed
24. I think the two actions next to business card, flip and download, are too black. They are secondary actions, make them duller. - Fixed
25. The package name box below "Business card" is too much visual noise. We can show the fastn-community.github.io/business-card on the right of the Business card.
26. In the code block at the bottom we show the copy icon on mouse over. This is good, as it does not show visual noise. In the top we show the action icons always, which leads to visual noise.
27. Make the "a fastn package" in the header a link to fastn. - Fixed
28. On desktop the hamburger menu looks like a bug, it is def not acting like hamburger menu. Hamburger menu should be on mobile, and should be used to show navigation sidebar. On desktop remove the hamburger menu.
